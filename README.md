# dynamite_ue4_fps

Gameplay tested only on LAN. We mostly trust client to omit complications, so there is potential gap for cheating

<b>How to play:</b>
* Hold right mouse button to activate aiming, and press left mouse button to throw dynamite
* While you're running your stamina will decrease, as your speed. To restore it you need to stop, and wait
* To refill ammo level, find yellow boxes on level, and get closer to it
